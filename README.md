# the picturebooth
This is a small web-based photo booth I’ve been building as a fun side project. It allows users to take photos using their webcam, apply simple filters, and then generate a classic photo booth strip that can be downloaded.

It’s not meant to be anything groundbreaking.
It’s just a personal project to experiment with JavaScript, CSS animations, and working with the webcam API in the browser.

What it does
-> Accesses the user’s webcam in the browser
-> Shows a countdown before each photo is taken
-> Captures multiple photos and stacks them into a vertical photo booth strip
-> Applies the same filter to all photos in the strip
-> Displays the final strip on a results page
-> Let's the user download the photo strip as an image


Tech used
-> HTML
-> CSS
-> Vanilla JavaScript
-> Browser MediaDevices / Canvas APIs
-> No frameworks, no libraries, just keeping it simple.


Project status
This project is still ongoing. I’m adding features as I go, tweaking the UI, and cleaning things up when I feel like it. It’s mainly a random, fun project to practice front-end skills and try out different ideas.

If something looks messy or unfinished, that’s probably because it is.
